# csv_music
This branch of csv_music is designed to create music independently of the length of the notes being played.


Converts CSV files (made by a .midi to .csv converter) into a file that only contains notes (and back again).

Inspired by this video by YouTuber Carykh: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SacogDL_4JU
This repository contains files used to turn .csv files into .cust files (just a name I made) and back again for use in Andrej Karpathy's character-based RNN (found here:https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

I converted the .midi files into .csv files using this utilty: http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/.
